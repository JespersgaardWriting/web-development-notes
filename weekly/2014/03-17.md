=======================
Getting better with beanstalkd. If I remove any function calls from the view, and simply pass data, it works fine. 

One issue: If I want to send mail, and it doesn't work for whatever reason, it writes errors to the error log. And then it tries again, and again, and again, relentlessly, until it's done. It would be nicer to wait for a little bit between tries... Not sure how to do that...

========================
Making a KForm class to handle lots of conversions for Bootstrap

This function:

    {{KForm::select('personal[gender]', 'Gender', Config::get('kweb.app.gender'))}}

...replaces all of this:

    <div class="form-group">
        {{Form::label('personal[gender]', 'Gender', array('class'=>'col-sm-2 control-label')) }}
        <div class="col-sm-2">
            {{Form::select('personal[gender]', Config::get('kweb.app.gender'), Null, array('class'=>'form-control')) }}
        </div>
        {{ $errors->first('personal[gender]') }}
    </div>

I think, though, that I may be rewriting something that's already done. There are two packages:

    Bootstrapper:
    https://github.com/patricktalmadge/bootstrapper/tree/develop

    Former:
    anahkiasen.github.io/former/

Former seems to do a lot of nifty things. How can I format the width of a label? (by default, it's entering class="control-label col-lg-2 col-sm-4"; I'd prefer "col-lg-1 col-sm-2")
