=======================

I just found something interesting, and I'm not sure what to do about it...  isset() does not seem to work with magic attributes passed through another class. 

So, I can have this:

```
    public function testHasAttribute()
    {
        $seeder = new TestSeeder;

        $seeder->insert('changelog','version,updated,notes',
            [['1.0','2014-01-01','This is a test']]
        );

        $data = ChangeLog::first();

        var_dump(isset($data->notes), $data->notes);
    }
```

... and get a true value ($data->notes is set). But if I wrap it in another class, where the other class just returns things from this class, it becomes false, even though we can still get $data->notes.

```php

    $model = ChangeLog::first();
    $data = new MiscTransferObject($model);

    class MiscTransferObject
    {
        private $model;

        public function __construct($model)
        {
            $this->model = $model;
        }

        public function __get($value)
        {
            return $this->model->$value;
        }
    }
```

In my subclass, I can include a __isset method:

```php
    public function __isset($value)
    {
        return isset($this->model->$value);
    }
```

So, any place that has __get() should probably use __isset(), with the same filters/tests, as well...

=========================
I'm running in to a situation where I want to query for all values, except for one given value. Not sure if I can handle this in Eloquent...

    return parent::newQuery($excludeDeleted)
        ->with('priceRates')
        ->whereHas('priceRates', function($q){
            return $q->where('account_code', '<>', '42200');
        });

... the whereHas makes it break, though...

Not sure how to fix this...

=========================
Hmmm... I have a class that has a child, and I want to override one part of the query statement. My class looks like this:

```php
    public function newQuery($excludeDeleted = true)
    {
        return parent::newQuery($excludeDeleted)
            ->whereNull('group_visit_id')
            ->whereNull('staff_id')
            ->where('group_rate',0)
            ->where('meal_plan_rate','<>',0);    
    }
```

My child class looks like this:

```php
    public function newQuery($excludeDeleted = true)
    {
        return parent::newQuery($excludeDeleted)
            ->whereNull('group_visit_id')
            ->whereNull('staff_id')
            ->where('group_rate',-1)
            ->where('meal_plan_rate','<>',0);    
    }
```

It fails, though (obviously), because it's looking for group_rate=0 and group_rate=1. Can I somehow remove the 'group_rate' clause? Without making another subclass? Hard to tell...
