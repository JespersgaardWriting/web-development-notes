========================
I'm having a difficult time downloading remote files via rsync. I even tried using the rsync-lib package (https://github.com/albertofem/rsync-lib), but haven't had any luck so far.

    $cmd = "rsync -avzh $server:$remote $local"; 

When it generates a command, I can run that from a terminal, and it will work perfectly. It won't run with exec(), though.

    $cmd = "rsync -avzh -e 'ssh -i $key' $user@$host:$remote $local"; 

Permissions set for a key; it works from a terminal, but not from exec().

What does work is getting the files via a ssh tunnel. It's a little ugly, but seems to be functional:

```php
    $connection = $this->getConfig('remote-connection');
    $remote_path = $this->getConfig('remote-attachments');
    $local_path = $this->getConfig('local-attachments');

    $result = '';
    SSH::into($connection)
        ->run(['ls -1 '.$remote_path], 
            function($line) use (&$result){
                $result = $line;
            }
        );

    $files = explode("\n", $result);
    foreach($files as $file) {
        if ($file) {
            $source = $remote_path.$file;
            $dest = $local_path.$file;

            SSH::into($connection)
                ->get($source, $dest);

            if (File::exists($dest))
                SSH::into($connection)->run(['rm ' .$remote_path.$file]);
        }
    }
```

It works, but it's a bit slow. I'll try to figure that out some more later.
