=======================

Can I create an Eloquent object without a table? I'd love to access things like joins, based on a very complex query...

So, in my query, I'll have something like:

    SELECT 'guest_visit' as source_table,
        'guest_visit_id' as record_id,
        other stuff...
    FROM reservations
    WHERE ...
    UNION
    SELECT 'staff' as source_table,
        'staff_id' as record_id,
        other stuff...
    FROM guest_staff_tab
    WHERE ...
    (and so on. There are 12 parts to this query) 

Ideally, I'd love to be able to convert the query to an Eloquent object, and join to some already-existing eloquent objects. All of the connecting fields (eg, things like 'name') are already well defined in both my guest and staff objects. 

I can create an empty Eloquent object, and feed it like this:

```php
    protected function getDetailData($dates, $code)
    {
        $sql = $this->selectDetailHead
            . $this->buildSqlQuery($dates)
            . $this->selectDetailFoot
            . "WHERE account_code=$code";

        $data = DB::select($sql);

        return (new GeneralLedger())->hydrate($data);
    }
```

How can I get staff name from that?

Can I use a polymorphic relation?

It's giving me a 'Base table or view not found' error. Maybe can't do that...

I can manually do it, though, like this:

```php
    public function getCustomerAttribute()
    {
        if ($this->link_table == 'guest_visit')
            return (new GuestVisit)->find($this->record_id);

        if ($this->link_table == 'group_visit')
            return (new GroupVisit)->find($this->record_id);

        if ($this->link_table == 'staff')
            return (new Staff)->find($this->record_id);

        if ($this->link_table == 'stewards')
            return (new Steward)->find($this->record_id);
    }
```

And that works, and it's a beautiful thing!

======================
Today, I want to see if I can test for multiple elements in an array. Basically, I want to do something like this:

```php
    $this->view
    ->shouldReceive('with')->once()
    ->with(Mockery::hasKey('dates'))
    ->with(Mockery::hasKey('codes'))
    ->with(Mockery::subset(['active'=>'41100']))
    ->andReturn($this->view);
```

Right now, it only gets the last one entered. Is there any way to get them all?

Yes, like this:

```php
    $this->view
        ->shouldReceive('with')->once()
        ->with(Mockery::on(function($args){
            return array_key_exists('dates', $args)
                && array_key_exists('codes', $args)
                && $args['active'] == 41100;
        }))
        ->andReturn($this->view);
```

I also found out that I can get a full sql statement (not truncated at all) via var_dump:

```php
    ini_set('xdebug.var_display_max_data', -1);
    var_dump($sql);
```
