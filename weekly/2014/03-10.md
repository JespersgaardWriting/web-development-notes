===============================

Queues are working great on my DEV system, but not on PROD. Why? Beanstalk is working fine, and I can see the contents of the currently active job. Getting an error that looks like this:

> Next exception 'ErrorException' with message 'Trying to get property of non-object

It's failing on Auth::user()->name. That works fine in sync, but not for the queue...

The queued job is also not submitting a subject (the subject is missing when I comment out Auth::user()->name)

For this week, work without queues...


Next issue: Advanced query scopes. I have a query that is having a problem:

```php
    public function scopeInDateRange($query, $start, $end)
    {
        return $query->whereHas(
            'vehicleReservation', 
            function($q) use ($start, $end) {

            return $q->whereBetween(
                'vehicle_adventure_reservations.reservation_date', 
                array($start, $end)
            );

                // return $q->inDateRange($start, $end);
            }
        );
    }
```

This generates the string:

```sql
    select * from `commission` 
    where `commission`.`veh_adv_res_id` is not null 
    and (
        select count(*) from "vehicle_adventure_reservations" 
        where "commission"."veh_adv_res_id" = `vehicle_adventure_reservations`.`veh_adv_res_id` 
        and "vehicle_adventure_reservations"."reservation_date" between 2014-01-10 and 2014-01-21
    ) >= 1
```

This string fails because it's invalid sql. This string works, though:

```sql
    select * from `commission` 
    where `commission`.`veh_adv_res_id` is not null 
    and (
        select count(*) from `vehicle_adventure_reservations` 
        where `commission`.`veh_adv_res_id` = `vehicle_adventure_reservations`.`veh_adv_res_id` 
        and `vehicle_adventure_reservations`.`reservation_date` between "2014-01-10" and "2014-01-21"
    ) >= 1
```

Ahhh... it's because I set the connection for commission, but not for vehicle_adventure_reservations. I can change the default connection to get all tables:

    Config::set('database.default', self::MYSQL_CONNECTION);
