==========================

I just ran into something interesting. I have a rate field in two tables, that get joined together; only the latter rate field is kept.

Tables are:

    reservations - information about specific reservation (also rate overrides)
    rate_table_lookup - information about standard rates

I connect the tables with a left join:

```php
    ->leftJoin('rate_table_lookup',
        'reservations.rate_type', '=', 
        'rate_table_lookup.rate_id'
    );
```

When I look at the result, there is only one rate field, and it is the value from the rate_table_lookup table. Is there any way to make sure we can keep the value from the reservations table?

Yes. The easiest way is actually to not use a join....

```php
    public function newQuery($excludeDeleted = true)
    {
        return parent::newQuery($excludeDeleted)
            ->with('priceRates');
    }
```
