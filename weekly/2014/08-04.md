=======================
I've found that we can do some really interesting things with closures. For instance, we can use a closure to select scopes from several classes, and assemble the data:

```php
    private $sources = [...];       // All of the models that should be used to collect data

    public function getSummary(DateRange $dates)
    {
        return $this->loadData(function ($model) use ($dates) {
            return $model
                ->inDateRange($dates)
                ->selectSummaryData();
        });
    }

    public function getDetailForCode(DateRange $dates, $accountCode)
    {
        return $this->loadData(function($model) use ($dates, $accountCode) {
            return $model
                ->inDateRange($dates)               // each of the models must include these scopes
                ->forAccountCode($accountCode);     // (eg, use an interface)
        });
    }

    private function loadData($closure)
    {
        $data = new Collection();                   
        $class = get_class($this);
        $namespace = substr($class, 0, strrpos($class, '\\')); 

        foreach($this->sources as $source) {            
            $name = $namespace.'\\'.$source;            // Get the fully namespaced name of the model
            $model = new $name;                         // Create a model object to search
            $found = $closure($model)->get();           // find data based on the closure
            $data = $data->merge($found);               // Merge the found data with the collection
        }

        return $data;
    }
```

That works very well, but there's an issue. It would be best to have the summary return some kind of a Summary object, instead of the standard model, because the calculations are different. (for instance, the pretax amount is item_charge * quantity, for detail; in the summary, we're looking at a summary of item charges; quantity is just for information). How can I do this?
