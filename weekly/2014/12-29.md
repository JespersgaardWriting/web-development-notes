==========================
I'm trying to get a couple of weird totals. Basically, I want to calculate tuition and fees, which (in the original database design) is listed as part of a staff tab. Ouch. So, some convoluted stuff to make it happen...

I don't think I can use a whereHas statement in a relationship with a custom method. Maybe, though...

I think I want something like this:

```php
    public function tuition()
    {
        return $this->hasMany('GuestStaffTab', 'staff_id')
        	->whereHas('GuestStaffTab', function($q){
                $q->forCategory('Guest Tuition Fees');
            });
        });
    }
```

That doesn't work, though. It gives me an error:

	Call to undefined method Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder::GuestStaffTab()

It will work as an attribute:

```php
    public function getTuitionAttribute()
    {
        return GuestStaffTab::where('staff_id', $this->id)->forCategory('Staff Tuition Fees')->get();
    }
```

Ideally, though, I'd really like it as a relationship. It would ultimately make things cleaner. No idea how to do that, though...

So, let's do it in a way it will work...

```php
    public function getTotalTuitionAttribute()
    {
        return $this->getTuitionQuery()->sum('total_charge');
    }

    public function getTuitionAttribute()
    {
        return $this->getTuitionQuery()->get();
    }

    private function getTuitionQuery()
    {
        return GuestStaffTab::where('staff_id', $this->id)->forCategory('Staff Tuition Fees');
    }
```

I'd also like the total_tab amount. This is going to be a bit trickier, because that is going to be everything in the tab EXCEPT for tuition. How can I do that?

From http://irclogs.laravel.io/2014-11-21/11:14#log-546f1ea8dc33d4765e00100c:

	ok, I found the answer for my question. You can pass two additional arguments which are optional - operator and count so it will look like this: ...whereHas('relation', function($q) { $q->.... }, '=', 0);

So, my tab attribute looks like this:

```php
    public function getTotalTabAttribute()
    {
        return GuestStaffTab::where('staff_id',$this->id)
            ->whereHas('rate', function($q){
                $q->forCategory('Staff Tuition Fees');
            }, '=', 0)->sum('total_charge');
    }
```

I can move that out to GuestStaffTab...

```php
    public function scopeExceptForCategory($query, $typeName)
    {
        return $query->whereHas('rate', function($q) use($typeName){
            $q->forCategory($typeName);
        }, '=', 0);
    }
```

So my final method will look like this:

```php
    public function getTotalTabAttribute()
    {
        return GuestStaffTab::where('staff_id',$this->id)
            ->exceptForCategory('Staff Tuition Fees')
            ->sum('total_charge');
    }
```
