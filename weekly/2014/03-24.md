=======================

Former is a very nice thing. I think I'm figuring out how to use it. 

I can create a horizontal form--very easy. Yay!

I need to figure out how to change the label width for a form....
Also how to change field width...

It appears that if Former doesn't recognize a command, it puts in a text box.

    Former::horizontal_open()    // opens a horizontal form
    Former::text('test1')        // creates a text box named test1
    Former::foo('test1')         // creates a text box named test1

I can set a default labelWidths, by modifying the configuration file. I'm not sure how to override that default in a given form...

    Former::text('foo')->class('col-sm-2')                  // does not style it as a form control, but is the correct width
    Former::text('foo')->addClass('col-sm-2')               // styled as a form control, full width
    Former::text('foo')->class('form-control col-sm-2')     // styled as a form control, full width

The html looks like this:

    <div class="col-sm-8 col-lg-10">
        <input class="form-control col-sm-2" id="buzz2" type="text" name="buzz2">
    </div>

How can I modify the containing div, instead of the form control itself?

    Former::addGroupClass('col-sm-6')           // creates another div outside of the class, in which you can group things

    <div class="form-group col-sm-6">
        <label for="buzz2" class="control-label col-sm-4 col-lg-2">This is a long label</label>
        <div class="col-sm-8 col-lg-10">
            <input class="form-control" id="buzz2" type="text" name="buzz2">
        </div>
    </div>

Nifty, but not exactly what I'm looking for.

```php
    Former::span2_text('foo')
    Former::small_text('foo')
    Former::small2_text('foo')
    Former::text('foo')->small()
    Former::text('foo')->small(2)
    Former::text('foo')->width(2)
    Former::text('foo')->sm(2)
    Former::text('foo')->lg(2)
    Former::text('foo')->large(2)
    Former::text('foo')->addContainerClass('col-sm-2')
    Former::text('foo')->wrapField('col-sm-2')
    Former::text('foo')->class('form-control col-sm-2 col-lg-1')
    Former::text('foo')->fieldWidth('lg', 2)
    Former::text('foo')->width('lg', 2)
```

None of these work... I might be missing something, or might have to write something. If I have to write something, I think it will go into TwitterBootstrap3.php, maybe change wrapField to use a user-set value, instead of $this->fieldWidth. Probably need a function to set that value, also.

Let's ask...

Next issue: how to do a group of related controls (eg, first_name, middle_name, last_name)?

And now, I find (kind of) an answer to both questions:

```php
    {{ Former::framework('TwitterBootstrap3')}}
    {{ Former::horizontal_open() }}

    {{ Former::group('name') }}
    <div class="col-sm-2">
    {{ Former::text('first')->placeholder('First') }}
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-2">
    {{ Former::text('middle')->placeholder('Middle') }}
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-2">
    {{ Former::text('last')->placeholder('Last') }}
    </div>

    {{ Former::closeGroup() }}
```

This works to set a single field size:

```php
    {{ Former::group('Gender', array('gender')) }}
        <div class="col-sm-2">
            {{ Former::select('gender')->options(Config::get('kweb.app.gender'))}}
        </div>
    {{ Former::closeGroup() }}
```

It's almost perfect. The only thing it still needs is to write an error message if we have an error. How can I do that with a group?

```php
    {{ Former::group('Foo', array('foo')) }}
        <div class="col-sm-2">
            {{ Former::text('foo')}}
            {{ Former::getErrors() }}
        </div>
    {{ Former::closeGroup() }}
```

... that does everything except for correct styling for the errors. Right now, I think I can let that go.

Creating and validating forms is definitely one weak spot that I have. Need to practie more of this.

... As it is, doing this with Former seems to be as tricky as doing it with Laravel form macros...

This is a single normal item:

```html
    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="test1" class="control-label col-sm-4 col-lg-2">Fuzz</label>
        <div class="col-sm-8 col-lg-10">
            <input class="form-control" id="test1" type="text" name="test1">
        </div>
    </div>
```

This is the same item, with an error:

```html
    <div class="form-group has-error">
        <label for="test1" class="control-label col-sm-4 col-lg-2">Fuzz</label>
        <div class="col-sm-8 col-lg-10">
            <input class="form-control" id="test1" type="text" name="test1" value="">
            <span class="help-block">The test1 field is required.</span>
        </div>
    </div>
```

Ultimately, I think I want html that looks like this:

```html
    <form accept-charset="utf-8" class="form-horizontal" method="POST">

        {{-- Multiple items on the same row --}}
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="Name" class="control-label col-sm-4 col-lg-2">Name</label>

            <div class="col-sm-2">
                <input class="form-control" placeholder="First" id="first_name" type="text" name="first_name">
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-2">
                <input class="form-control" placeholder="Middle" id="middle_name" type="text" name="middle_name">
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-2">
                <input class="form-control" placeholder="Last" id="last_name" type="text" name="last_name">
            </div>
        </div>

        {{-- Short item on a row by itself --}}
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="foo" class="control-label col-sm-4 col-lg-2">Foo</label>
            <div class="col-sm-2">
                <input class="form-control" placeholder="Foo" id="foo" type="text" name="foo">
            </div>
        </div>

        {{-- Short item with an error. Error shows on same line. --}}
        <div class="form-group has-error">
            <label for="bar" class="control-label col-sm-4 col-lg-2">Bar</label>
            <div class="col-sm-2">
                <input class="form-control" placeholder="Bar" id="bar" type="text" name="bar">
            </div>
            <span class="help-block">The bar field is required. This will show on the same line.</span>
        </div>

        {{-- Full-width item with an error. Error shows on next line. --}}
        <div class="form-group has-error">
            <label for="fuzz" class="control-label col-sm-4 col-lg-2">Fuzz</label>
            <div class="col-sm-8 col-lg-10">
                <input class="form-control" id="fuzz" type="text" name="fuzz">
                <span class="help-block">The fuzz field is required. This will show on the next line.</span>
            </div>
        </div>

    </form>
```

I'm not attached to Former, or to any other specific way of making these happen, but I would like the result to end up like this. How to do that?

=======================
I'm getting a very strange error when attempting to run unit tests this morning:

> PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined method Composer\Autoload\ClassLoader::setPsr4() in C:\wamp\www\active\kweb\vendor\composer\autoload_real.php on line 40

Nothing has changed in the setup. I open ClassLoader.php, and see the setPsr4 function. Why isn't php seeing it?

> PHPUnit's classloader is loaded before the local one and the class is outdated there it seems, so you should do a composer global dump to update that autoloader then it should be fine

That doesn't work for me...

I see that phpunit is in my WAMP directory. Can I go there to rebuild?

I'm getting a permission denied to generate a file. 

    chmod go+w vendor/composer/*

Weird... Still getting permission errors...

    chmod go+w vendor/composer
    chmod go+w vendor/autoload.php
    chmod go+w composer.lock

    composer update
    composer dump-autoload

That seems to have fixed it.


Moving on to Form handling. I like the syntax that Former uses. I like how it looks. The only problems that I have with it are related to field sizing and (possibly) error handling. To me, this would be ideal:

    {{ Former::horizontal_open()->withRules($rules) }}

        {{ Former::group('name', array('last_name', 'first_name', 'middle_name')) }}
            {{ Former::text('first_name')->width('sm',2)->placeholder('First') }}
            {{ Former::text('middle_name')->width('sm',2)->placeholder('Middle') }}
            {{ Former::text('last_name')->width('sm',2)->placeholder('Last') }}
        {{ Former::closeGroup() }}

        {{ Former::select('gender')->width(['lg'=>1,'sm'=>2])->options(Config::get('kweb.app.gender'))}}

    {{ Former::close() }}

It should know to put error messages on the next line (before the wrapper div) when there is no width specified; it should put error messages on the same line (after the wrapper div) when there is a width specified. 

Add a widths property to the Field class...
Add functions width($viewport, $width), and getWidths()...

    public function width($viewport, $width)
    {
        $this->widths[$viewport] = $width;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getWidths()
    {
        return $this->widths;
    }

Add a getFieldWidth($field) method to TwitterBootstrap3.php:

  protected function getFieldWidth($field)
  {
    if (! $field->getWidths())
      return $this->fieldWidth;

    $fieldWidthClass = '';

    $viewports = $this->getFrameworkOption('viewports');
    foreach ($field->getWidths() as $viewport => $columns) {
      if ($viewport) {
        $fieldWidthClass  .= " col-$viewports[$viewport]-".$columns;
      }
    }
    return $fieldWidthClass;
  }

It looks like one critical piece is in Group.php, function prependAppend. If there is nothing to prepend, or if there is nothing to append, it renders the field. At that point, we can't look inside any more. If we can move that to the framework class, we could make a change...

The render function goes through these steps:

    Input* <- Field <- FormerObject* <- Element <- Tag* <- TreeObject

=======================
Back in the office.... The Group::wrapField method is where my field changes from a Field instance to a string.  

    public function wrapField($field)
    {
        $label  = $this->getLabel($field);
        $field  = $this->prependAppend($field);      //    <---- right here. prependAppend returns a string
        $field .= $this->getHelp();

        return $this->wrap($field, $label);
    }

The string then gets sent to $this->wrap, which calls the framework's wrapField method:

    public function wrap($contents, $label = null)
    {
        $group = $this->open();
        $group .= $label;
        $group .= $this->app['former.framework']->wrapField($contents);
        $group .= $this->close();

        return $group;
    }

The framework's wrapField method receives a string, but I need a class instance to get the field width...

This is much harder than it seems initially.
