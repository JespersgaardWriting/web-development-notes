======================

I'm back in the office after Laracon. I learned a lot of things there, and hope to apply them in the near future.

Right now, I have a very slow query running. Not sure why it's so slow...

Here's a way to see how long a process takes:

    $start = microtime(true);

    // run the process

    $elapsed = round(microtime(true) - $start,3);
    var_dump($elapsed);

The basic query is running very fast... Maybe it's running too many queries? Run this to get the query data:

    var_dump(DB::getQueryLog());

Ahhh... I'm not preloading related tables, so it's really, really slow. Can I load them via a scope? It looks like I can!

    public function scopeLoadRooms($query)
    {
        return $query->with('room');
    }

Next question: how can I test that? I'd guess that I just want the query to receive a 'with' statement. Hmmmm....

    public function test_eager_loading()
    {
        $query = Mockery::mock('MockQuery');
        $query->shouldReceive('with')->with('guest')->once()->andReturn($query);

        $this->test->scopeLoadPeople($query);
    }

This works!
