=========================
I'm having a problem with Access, today. The route to a page is /reports/charge-types. This is a report for which I'd like to include parameters, so it responds to both GET and POST. GET returns the default (for today), POST returns a report with parameters.

In Chrome and IE, it works perfectly. If I look at the source, I see:
    
    <form method="POST" action="http://kdb.dev/reports/charge-type" ...>

In the Access WebBrowser control, it's not working. The source looks like this:

    <form method="POST" action="//reports/charge-type" ...>

I'm just calling Form::open(); maybe it needs more routing information?

    {{ Form::open(array('route'=>'reports.charge-type.store', 'class'=>'form-inline')) }}

The route itself on this is weird... It doesn't seem to have a name, but when I entered the entire name, it didn't work. Instead, the controller looks like this:

    Route::resource('charge-type', 'ChargeTypeController',
        array('only'=>array('index','store'), 'as'=>''));

And that, for some very strange reason, works fine.
