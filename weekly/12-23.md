================================
Working some more on initial tests and controller functions for the reboot. 

I think I should split the tests into two parts: One for a controller test, the other for an integration test. The controller tests look like this:

```php
class PeopleControllerTest extends ControllerTestCase
{
    const ADAPTER = 'Kalani\KDB\AdapterInterfaces\PeopleAdapterInterface';

    public function setUp()
    {
        parent::setUp();

        $this->model = Mockery::mock(self::ADAPTER);
        App::instance(self::ADAPTER, $this->model);
    }

    public function testIndex()
    {
        $this->model->shouldReceive('listPeople')->once()
            ->andReturn(array());

        $this->call('GET', '/people');

        $this->assertResponseOK();
    }

    public function testShow()
    {
        $this->model->shouldReceive('getPerson')->with(1)->once()
            ->andReturn((object)array('name'=>'FirstName LastName'));

        $this->call('GET', '/people/1');

        $this->assertResponseOK();
        $this->assertSee('FirstName LastName', '#content');
    }

    public function testShowMissingRecord()
    {
        $this->model->shouldReceive('getPerson')->with(0)->once();

        $this->call('GET', '/people/0');

        $this->assertResponseStatus(404);
        $this->assertSee('not found', '#content');
    }
```

The integration tests look more like this:

```php
class PeopleIntegrationTest extends ControllerTestCase
{
    public function setUp()
    {
        // migrate and seed tables as needed 
        parent::setUp();
    }

    public function testShow()
    {
        $this->call('GET', '/people/1');

        $this->assertResponseOK();
        $this->assertSee('FirstName LastName', '#content');
    }

    public function testShowMissingRecord()
    {
        $this->call('GET', '/people/0');

        $this->assertResponseStatus(404);
        $this->assertSee('not found', '#content');
    }
```

I'm starting to think that I may have a problem with the mocks. In my views, I'm calling {{ $person->name }}, and that works fabulously. But... as soon as I change a view, to enter anything else, I'll start getting undefined property failures. I don't want my mock to have to include every field value... Is there any way to just reflect what is sent in?  (eg, if I enter $person->foo, return 'foo')? 

Note: This is JUST for unit tests, NOT for integration tests. Integration tests should fail if the view is requesting data that doesn't exist. But I want unit tests to be simpler.

I can create a MockModel class pretty easily:

```php
class MockModel
{
    private $attributes = array();

    public function __construct(array $attributes)
    {
        foreach($attributes as $key=>$value) {
            $this->attributes[$key] = $value;
        }
    }

    public function __get($attribute)
    {
        if (isset($this->attributes[$attribute])) {
            return $this->attributes[$attribute];
        }

        return $attribute;
    }
}
```

I'm having a problem, though... My crawler is returning false positives. 

    $this->assertTrue(
        $crawler->filter("$inTag:contains({$seeWhat})")->count() > 0,
        "{$seeWhat} not found in tag {$inTag} of response"
    );

This is returning True if the text is set (correctly) to FirstName LastName, or (incorrectly) to FirstName XXX LastName. Hmmmm.....

It's the space. The first word has to be the same, but it seems to ignore anything after a space. Ahhh... it has to be entered in quotation marks:

```php
    public function assertSee($seeWhat, $inTag='html')
    {
        $crawler = $this->client->getCrawler();

        $this->assertTrue(
            $crawler->filter("$inTag:contains('{$seeWhat}')")->count() > 0,
            "'{$seeWhat}' not found in tag '{$inTag}' of the response"
        );
    }
```

In my MockModel class, it would be nice to be able to work with demeter chains. Not sure how to do that, though...

    $person->foo->bar   // how to do?
    $person->foo        // works fine, automatically

================================
I just ran into something weird on my production server. I have a query that looks like this:

    public function scopeForDate($query, $date)
    {
        return $query->where('reservation_date', $date);
    }

On the staging server, it works fine. On the production server, it doesn't work. Instead, I have to use this:

    public function scopeForDate($query, $date)
    {
        return $query->whereRaw("DATE(reservation_date) = '$date'");
    }

Production server:  5.5.31-0ubuntu0.12.04.1-log
Staging server:     5.5.34-0ubuntu0.12.04.1-log
 
Could it be a bug or setting in mysql? On the server:

    sudo apt-get upgrade

It says that there are changes to mysql being kept back... Do I dare do apt-get dist-upgrade on my stable server?

It looks like a fairly short list of things, mostly mysql... Give it a shot.

I ran into an issue where I need to automatically add something to a query, whenever any query is run. Basically, working on a project in which a prior developer used the "one true lookup table" antipattern. (I've been there, thinking that it's a good idea, myself... turns out not to be. :-)

So, for the model that captures those records, until I get the table refactored, I'd like to do something like this:

```php
    class SpaFacility extends Eloquent
    {
        // YUCK! This will eventually change.
        protected $table="global_dropdown_lists"                    
        protected $primaryKey = 'code';

        // I hope to find a way to automatically apply this 
        // to every instance in which this model is requested
        public function scopeForEverything($query)
        {
            return $query->where('category', 'SpaFacility');
        }
    }
```

In the forum, someone suggested creating an event and listener... but there's nothing to attach it to... What is interesting, though is that all queries go through a newQuery function. Which I can override. :-)

If a model had a 'querying' event, I could just attach an observer. It doesn't, though. It would be trivial to add to Laravel... but might not be something used by many people.

Basically, add this function:

    public static function querying($callback)
    {
        static::registerModelEvent('querying', $callback);
    }

Add this to newQuery:

    if ($this->fireModelEvent('querying') === false) return false;

Add `querying` to the array returned from getObservableEvents.

But I don't need to do that. 

I think I can get by with just overriding the newQuery method:

```php
    public function newQuery($excludeDeleted=True)
    {
        $query = parent::newQuery($excludeDeleted);
        
        return $query->where('category', 'SpaFacility');
    }
```

I think that will work...

And it does. :-)

================================
OK... Let's see if we can play with codeception some more...

I'm having a problem with functional tests in codeception. Trying to do $I->click('Submit'), but the functional test doesn't see it. To get it, I'm using {{ Form::submit() }} in the view. It gets rendered as <input type="submit">

The way to do that is: $I->click('input[type=submit]');
