====================

Doh! I just found out that I didn't update node or npm on my staging machine. I'd really like to get those working, now, so that I can check stuff before pushing out a bunch of big changes. How did I install/update node and npm?

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js  
    sudo apt-get update  
    sudo apt-get install nodejs

NOTE: If your system does not have add-apt-repository, it can be installed like so:

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties

This installs both nodejs and npm.

    npm install

Everything looks like it's there...

    npm install bower
    npm install gulp

Not running... On my main system, files for gulp and bower are outside of the project, in a separate folder. How can I do that? Hmmm....

    sudo npm install -g bower
    sudo npm install -g gulp

That worked.

    bower install
    gulp update

...and I'm good to go.

... except that my machine is complaining that fileinfo is not found...

    edit `C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.4.3\php.ini`   to remove the comment before `extension=php_fileinfo.dll`

... and we're good.
