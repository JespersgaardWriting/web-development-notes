===========================

I'm using the laravel 4 starter kit:

    https://github.com/brunogaspar/laravel4-starter-kit

`git clone` to pull it down; delete the .git folder; `git init` to create a new project; set permissions for the app/storage folders, enter credentials in app/config/database. Add a couple of desired projects to composer.json and app.php:

    "require-dev": {
          "kalani/facade-root": "dev-master",    
          "way/generators": "dev-master"
      },

    'Way\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider',
    'Kalani\FacadeRoot\FacadeRootServiceProvider',

Then run:

    composer update --no-scripts --dev
    composer update
    php artisan app:install

Hmmmm... That's about a 15-minute process to get a simple blog.

Now, generate my components:

    php artisan generate:scaffold ticket --fields='summary:string,description:text,assignee_id:integer,creator_id:integer,category_id:integer,priority:string,due:datetime'

    php artisan generate:scaffold response --fields='ticket_id:integer,responder_id:integer,description:text'

    php artisan generate:scaffold recipient --fields='ticket_id:integer,recipient_id:integer,recipient_type:string'

    php artisan generate:scaffold category --fields='name:string'

    php artisan migrate
    
Still just a few minutes. Now, we can go in to make changes...

How can I quickly load things via json?

``` php
$('#priority')
[<select id=​"priority" name=​"priority">​</select>​]

$('#priority')
[<select id=​"priority" name=​"priority">​
<option value=​"1">​1​</option>​
</select>​]
``` 

I can write the html based on an ajax call for some elements...

Reading about bower... Trying to figure out how to get front-end stuff to work. Front-end file management is being a bit of a bear...

Bower requires npm... Download for dev from http://nodejs.org/download/

It looks like most of the packages I'm using are available via bower. KineticJS being the notable exception...

    npm install -g bower

(the first time I tried this, it failed. The problem was that it used windows line-endings instead of unix line-endings. Once I changed that, it seemed to install successfully). Trying to run it, though, is giving issues. It can't seem to find the module. 

> $ bower
>
> module.js:340
>     throw err;
>           ^
> Error: Cannot find module '\\<home>\AppData\Roaming\npm\Roaming\npm\node_modules\bower'
>     at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:338:15)
>     at Function.Module._load (module.js:280:25)
>     at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10)
>     at startup (node.js:119:16)
>     at node.js:901:3

On the test server, I can run:

    sudo apt-get install npm
    npm install -g bower

(it didn't work, though...) From /var/www/kdb/npm-debug.log:

> info using npm@1.1.4
> info using node@v0.6.12

The Windows version (which is there) is npm 1.3.5. Maybe it's not compatible? Hmmm....

I was hoping that would work, because I haven't been able to figure out a good front-end package management system yet. 

Moving on.... This data is sent to the server:

    _token:6jSE2j9W7hc9rTCl9QhiyF3A1GyLWChM6SMxUhAP
    summary:test
    description:test
    assignee:
    assignee_id:1
    department_id:​"1"undefined
    category_id:​"1"undefined
    priority:​"3"
    due:

These errors are coming back from the server:

    The department id must be an integer.
    The category id must be an integer.
    The priority may not be greater than 1 characters.

The server is seeing these values:

    '_token' => string '<...>' (length=40)
    'summary' => string '' (length=0)
    'description' => string '' (length=0)
    'assignee' => string '' (length=0)
    'assignee_id' => string '' (length=0)
    'department_id' => string 'â€‹"1"undefined' (length=15)
    'category_id' => string 'â€‹"1"undefined' (length=15)
    'priority' => string 'â€‹"3"' (length=6)
    'due' => string '' (length=0)

The three really confusing ones are all select boxes, with the default selected in each case... They should return null...

It's caused by the function that sends data to the client:

``` js
    function loadAjaxForSelectBox(url, selectBox) 
    {
        $.ajax({
            url: url,
        }).done(function(data) {
            var add = '';
            data.forEach(function(entry) {
                add += '<option value=​"' + entry.id + '"' + entry.extra +'>'+ entry.label + '​</option>​';
            });
            $(selectBox).html(add);
        });
    }
```

When I send in the array, it looks like this:

``` json
    [<select id=​"department_id" name=​"department_id">​
    <option value=​"​"1"undefined">​Admin&#8203;​</option>​"&#8203;"
    <option value=​"​"2"undefined">​Cafe&#8203;​</option>​"&#8203;"
    ...
    </select>​]
```

It's because 'extra' isn't defined for all objects. I changed the script to this, and it works fine:

``` js
function loadAjaxForSelectBox(url, selectBox) 
{
    $.ajax({
        url: url,
    }).done(function(data) {
        var selectableItems = '';
        data.forEach(function(entry) {
            var extra = '';
            if(typeof entry.extra != 'undefined') {
                extra = entry.extra;
            }

            var newItem = '<option value=' + entry.id + extra + '>' + entry.label + '</option>' ;
            selectableItems += newItem;
        });
        $(selectBox).html(selectableItems);
    });
}
```

I wonder: if I use it at all, should I include it for all objects on the server-side?

Trying to figure some things out with Carbon... How to read/write values?

Create a Carbon object from a mysql datetime value:

    $c = Carbon::createFromTimestamp(strtotime($model->date_time_field));

Output a formatted date string (Mon d, YYYY):

    $c->toFormattedDateString();        //  Aug 7, 2013
    $c->toDayDateTimeString();          //  Wed, Aug 7, 2013 10:09 PM
    $c->format($format);                //  Any format from http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php


Bootstrap Content Width
---------------------------

I'm still working on tables, too. I'd like to make them sortable, and sizable...

The first thing that I'm running into is bootstrap. I can't figure out how to get a 1200px column, instead of 940px column. The actual screen is definitely wide enough...

Let's try some tests...

I can get a fluid page with this:

``` html
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container-fluid" style="background: #ccc;">

          <h1>Foo</h1>
          <p>bar</p>

            <div class="row-fluid" style="background: #aaa">
                <div class="span4" style="background: #eee">
                    Foo
                </div>
            </div>
        </div> <!-- /container -->

    <script src="assets/js/jquery.1.10.2.min.js"></script>
    <script src="assets/js/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
    <script src="assets/jquery-ui/jquery-ui-built.js"></script>    
    </body>
    </html>
```

That's not going to center my table, though. Really, all I want is a 1200px column that's centered.

Ahhhh... It looks like the trick is to use two stylesheets, with a container div:

``` html
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/bootstrap-responsive.min.css">

    <div class="container">
```

Using `row` is giving me some space on the left; not sure what's up with that. `row-fluid` gives me the expected result.

Getting sortable, ajax-ready, scrollable, paginated tables seems to be much trickier than I had planned. Maybe just use datatables?

======================================

I've been having a problem with testing. Basically, I was trying to use accessors and scopes, like this:

```php
    class Ticket extends Eloquent {
        public function showFoo() {
            return 'foo';
        }
        public function getPriorityTextAttribute() {
            if ($this->priority >= 5)
                return 'High';
            return 'Low';
        }
        public function scopeUnassigned($query) {
            $query->where('assignee_id', 0);
        }
        ... etc
    }
```

From my controller, or routes file, this worked perfectly:

```php
    public function getTicketPriorities() {
        $tickets = Ticket::unassigned()->get();
        foreach($tickets as $ticket)
            var_dump($ticket->priorityText);
    }
```

... but my tester wasn't happy at all with that. I had to do this to run the accessor:

```php
    public function testHumanReadablePriorityLevels()
    {
        $test = new Ticket;
        $test->priority = 1;
        // $this->assertEquals('Low', $test->priorityText);
        // This does not work in the test; Undefined property: Ticket::$priorityText

        $this->assertEquals('Low', $test->getPriorityTextAttribute(), '1 should be low');
        // This does work in the test; I'm not crazy about it, but can live with it
    }
```

Honestly, the call should be to $test->priorityText; it should just work. I was getting all sorts of errors, though, particularly when I tried scopes, too. And I worked out a really convoluted way of getting things to fail gracefully...

```php
        $processor = new Illuminate\Database\Query\Processors\Processor;
        $grammar = new Illuminate\Database\Query\Grammars\Grammar;
        $dbBuilder = new Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder(DB::connection(), $grammar, $processor);
        $builder = new Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder($dbBuilder);
        var_dump(Ticket::scopeUnassigned($builder));
```

Ummmm. yuck!

This morning, I decided to reduce it to its simplest pieces, so I tried a CatTest (as shown in Jeffrey Way's book). It's pretty simple:

```php
    class Cat extends Eloquent
    {
        public function setAgeAttribute($age)
        {
            $this->age = $age * 7;
        }
    }
```

```php
    class CatTest extends TestCase
    {
        public function testShouldReturnCatYears()
        {
            $cat = new Cat;
            $cat->age = 6;
            $this->assertEquals(42, $cat->age);
        }
    }
```

That also failed in my project. So, I was thinking I didn't understand testing at all. I pulled a fresh copy of Laravel, and tried it again. This time, it worked. Meaning that something is wrong in the configuration of my original project. So let's work with this new configuration for a while.

I set up testing for a Ticket object, and am finding that it's failing, too. Basically, the first time I run a test, it works fine:

``` php
    public function testFoo()
    {
        $user = \Mockery::mock('User')->shouldReceive('getAttribute')->twice()->andReturn(1, 2)->getMock();
        $mock = Sentry::shouldReceive('getUser')->andReturn($user);
        
        $test = new Ticket;
        $this->assertEquals(2, $test->assignedToMe()->count(), 'should return 2 for user 1');
        $this->assertEquals(1, $test->assignedToMe()->count(), 'should return 1 for user 2'); 
    }
```

The second time I try to access the $mock object (and I can literally just copy the above method to call it testFoo2), it fails. I start getting weird errors.

I tracked it down to the $mock object; Laravel is returning the same mock object for both instances, and it's returning old data. var_dump(get_class($user),get_class($mock)) shows that it's pulling the same name for $mock, in both cases. When I put a couple of var_dumps in Illumiate\Support\Facades\Facade.php:shouldReceive, I get:

    string(19) "check mock...sentry"
    string(17) "Mockery_583674228"
    string(28) "Mockery\\CompositeExpectation"
    Fstring(19) "check mock...sentry"
    string(9) "isMock..."
    string(17) "Mockery_606363999"
    string(28) "Mockery\\CompositeExpectation"

So... how do I force it to refresh, or reset? Essentially, I need to get a new mock object for each call; they should each be returning different data. 

Or, I can just ignore Laravel's shouldReceive function, and go with some more standard mockery stuff:

```php
    public function setupMockUser($id)
    {
        $user = \Mockery::mock('User')->shouldReceive('getAttribute')->andReturn($id)->getMock();
        $sentry = \Mockery::mock('Cartalyst\Sentry\Sentry');
        $sentry->shouldReceive('getUser')->andReturn($user);
        Cartalyst\Sentry\Facades\Laravel\Sentry::swap($sentry);
    }
```

That works beautifully. To use it in the classes, I do this:

```php
    /**
     * @dataProvider getItemsAssignedToMe
     */
    public function testItemsAssignedToMe($id, $count)
    {
        $test = new Ticket;

        $this->setupMockUser($id);
        $this->assertEquals($count, $test->assignedToMe()->count(), "should return $count for user $id");
    }

    public function getItemsAssignedToMe()
    {
        return array( array(1, 2), array(2, 1), array(3, 0), );
    }
```



Sunday, 11 August 2013 
======================================

Attempting to test relationships on the model, but not having much luck. I'm getting an error:

Mockery\Exception\NoMatchingExpectationException: No matching handler found for Ticket::belongsTo("Category", "category_id"). Either the method was unexpected or its arguments matched no expected argument list for this method.

I'm using the Way Test Helpers module; it looks like it's failing when it tries to call $class->$relationship()

It's doing a partial mock on $class."[$type]"  (eg, Ticket[belongsTo]); then shouldReceive(belongsTo)->with('/category/i') ... I don't understand that with statement at all. Hmmmm.... I think it's doing a case insensitive match.

I understand the assertRespondsTo method; it works well.

... and it looks like the Way Test Helper doesn't handle parameters in a belongsTo statement. This works:

```php
    Mockery::mock('Ticket[belongsTo]')
        ->shouldReceive('belongsTo')
        ->with('/category/i', 'category_id')
        ->once();
```

This doesn't:

```php
    $class = Mockery::mock($class."[$type]");
    $class->shouldReceive($type)
          ->with(str_singular($relationship))
          ->with('/' . str_singular($relationship) . '/i')
          ->once();
```

It could possibly be a compatibility issue with php 5.4, but as written, the Way test helper won't work for me. :-(  

So, let's go with what works:

```php
    /**
     * @dataProvider getItemsForBelongsToUser
     */
    public function testAssignedToUser($myID, $otherID, $otherText)
    {
        $test = new Ticket;
        $test->assignee_id = $myID;

        $this->assertTrue(method_exists($test, 'assignedTo'));

        if (is_null($otherID)) {
            return $this->assertNull($test->assignedTo);
        }

        $this->assertNotNull($test->assignedTo);
        $this->assertEquals($test->assignee_id, $test->assignedTo->id);
        $this->assertEquals($otherText, $test->assignedTo->text);
    }

    public function getItemsForBelongsToUser()
    {
        return array( array(1, 1, 'foo'), array(2, 2, 'bar'), array(3, Null, Null), );
    }
```

I'm finding that I need to improve my workflow... testing and git are not working happily together.

I have tests set up for my TicketTest; they work perfectly. I also had tests for categories which worked well. I put them together, and we get some crashiness happening.
