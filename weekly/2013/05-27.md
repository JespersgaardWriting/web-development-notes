=======================

This morning, I'd like to combine laravel with the javascript work I did yesterday, as a simple kata. I'd like to be able to create, read, update, and delete spa records. These fields:

    id
    room
    in
    out
    therapist
    guest

It works very nicely! Yay!

Let's try some stuff with Bootstrap...

Hmmm... using the entire area of my page seems to be weirdly difficult. All that I want is a 3-column grid with a header and footer; the left column should stick to the left, and the right column should stick to the right side. Bootstrap wants to have everything float in the middle.

I sent the .container to 100% width. I'm not sure whether or not that's a bad idea. It seems to me that the standard scaffolding doesn't really work for my purposes. The one thing that I'm not sure about is how to set the width of the center column. I'm thinking about javascript for that... Basically, I want 200 for left, 200 for right, and everything else for the main section.

Ahhh... It can be done as a css-only solution. Yay!

This layout type is actually called the Holy Grail. :-)  Fixed sides, and a flexible center. There's another article about it at:

I'm having a problem pulling in FontAwesome:
Resource interpreted as Font but transferred with MIME type application/octet-stream: "http://kata/assets/font/fontawesome-webfont.woff?v=3.0.1". 

The solution was to add these mime types to /etc/mime.types:

    application/vnd.ms-fontobject                   eot
    application/octet-stream                        otf
    application/x-font-ttf                          ttf
    application/x-font-woff                         woff

Today, I want to load data for a lot of ancillary tables, and develop interfaces for them.

Some will just be pulled from ISO standards...

Countries:

States/Provinces:
http://www.commondatahub.com/live/geography/state_province_region/iso_3166_2_state_codes
(actually, this may be overkill... I think we really just care about US and Canada)

Cities in US and Canada!??!!

(this is definitely overkill, but interesting that it's there. It list populations, but not coordinates)

I'm trying to use Ardent to save myself some code on some of these classes, but it's not really working. I'm not sure why. I'll revisit it later...
