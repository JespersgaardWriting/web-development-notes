Working on vehicle reservations... How can I mock a vehicle record?

```php
    public function testHasVehicle()
    {
        App::instance('Vehicle', new MockModel(array('vehicle_id'=>2)));

        $found = $this->vehicleReservation->find(18069);
        $this->assertNotNull($found->vehicle);
    }
```

Also, at one point, I successfully copied some data structures from the legacy environment to a test environment. How did I do that?

I found out that it's easy to use an alternate database in models. Just prefix the name:

    protected $table = 'model';                 // uses the standard database
    protected $table = 'database.model';        // uses an alternate database with the same connection
