==============================

I think I have the TestMock thing figured out, but am not sure if it would be considered a good practice to use...

```php
class SomethingTest
{
    public function testPersonBirthdate()
    {
        $mock = \Mockery::mock('Foo')
            ->shouldReceive('a')->andReturn('b')->getMock();
        $this->setMockAlias('KDate', $mock);
        $person = new Kalani\Core\Person\Person;

        // This will ensure that it is assigning my mock KDate object
        // to a birthdate attribute.
        // Note that method a is just to test that there is a birthdate
        // attribute; it doesn't actually exist on a real kdate
        $this->assertEquals('b', $person->birthdate->a());
    }

    public function testPersonAge()
    {
        $mock = \Mockery::mock('KDate')
            ->shouldReceive('yearsAgo')->once()
            ->andReturn('bar')->getMock();
        $this->setMockAlias('KDate', $mock);
        $person = new Kalani\Core\Person\Person;

        // This will ensure that the KDate yearsAgo method is called
        $this->assertEquals('bar', $person->getAgeAttribute());
    }

    protected function setMockAlias($class, $mock=Null, $alias='TestStub')
    {
        $testStub = new TestStub($mock);
        $this->app->share(function($app) { return $testStub; });

        $loader = \Illuminate\Foundation\AliasLoader::getInstance();
        $loader->alias($class, $alias);
    }
}


< ?php namespace Kalani\Tests;

class TestStub
{
    public static $mock;

    public function __construct($mock)
    {
        if (is_object($mock) && strpos(get_class($mock), 'Mockery') !== False) {
            self::$mock = $mock;
        }
    }

    public function __set($property, $value)
    {
        $call = 'set:' . $property;
        return self::$mock->$call($value);
    }

    public function __get($value)
    {
        $call = 'get:' . $value;
        return self::$mock->$call();
    }

    public function __call($method, $args)
    {
        return call_user_func_array(
            array(self::$mock, $method),
            $args
        );
    }
}
```

... but for some unknown reason, it suddenly just stopped working. It's now instantiating the standard KDate objects, again, and not working on tests that worked a few minutes ago. WTF???

I really don't know how my class is still picking up the old DateHandler object; it should be picking up my TestStub class, instead....

It looks like the AliasLoader is loading KDate before it adds the new KDate object. Why would it do that?

I put in some var_dumps to trace what's happening:

> "AliasLoader:load Route"
> "Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route"
> "AliasLoader:load KDate"
> "Kalani\Utilities\DateHandler\DateHandler"
> "construct"
> "Mockery_1854009056"
> "adding: KDate  Kalani\Tests\TestStub"

Here are some more:

> "AliasLoader:load Route"
> "Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route"
> "testPersonAge:1"
> "setMockDate:1"
> "AliasLoader:load KDate"
> "Kalani\Utilities\DateHandler\DateHandler"
> "setMockDate:2"
> "setMockDate:4"
> "construct TestStub"
> "for class: Mockery_73285836"
> "adding: KDate  Kalani\Tests\TestStub"
> "setMockDate:5"
> "testPersonAge:2"
> "testPersonAge:3"
> "DateHandler:constructor"
> "DateHandler:yearsAgo"

So, when the date is mocked, this line is called:

    $mock = \Mockery::mock('KDate');

AliasLoader then loads a KDate object.
After the mock has been set, AliasLoader does not reload KDate... but I think it should.

Actually, the only thing that AliasLoader::load does is sets a class alias. Simple enough...
Or not... we can't redeclare KDate... Can we delete the old class alias, somehow?

Hmmmm.... There is no way to unset a class_alias once it's created. So, don't call the actual thing in the mock... This works fine:

    $mock = \Mockery::mock('KDateMock');

Ahhh... unless I use the actual alias somewhere else. I can't change an alias mid-stream in testing. (I can't use one class in one place, and another somewhere else). Hmmmm....

get_declared_classes() shows me a list of all declared classes in the system...

There's still no way to delete it, though. I think I just hit a limit of php. Full stop. For reference, here are my objects. Again, they work fabulously in isolation, but fail when combined with other tests (in which the real alias, or some other definition of the alias, is used).

==============================

New strategy. Can we do this as a facade? If DateHandler is a Facade, it can be split out. But I don't think there's a way to instantiate it simply, just calling `new DateHandler('date')`. Actually, the facade pattern still isn't bad, though... `DateHandler::make('date')`...

And it works perfectly. And easily; just a few minor modifications:

```php
class DateHandler extends \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Facade 
{
    protected static function getFacadeAccessor() { return 'date-handler'; }
}

class DateHandlerServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider 
{
    public function register()
    {
        $this->app['date-handler'] = $this->app->share(function($app)
        {
            return new DateHandler();
        });
    }
}

class Person extends Eloquent
{
    ...

    public function setBirthdateAttribute($birthdate)
    {
        $this->attributes['birthdate'] = \KDate::make($birthdate);
    }

    public function getBirthdateAttribute($value)
    {
        return \KDate::make($value);
    }

    public function getAgeAttribute()
    {
        return $this->birthdate->yearsAgo();
    }
}

class PersonTest extends \TestCase
{
    ...
    public function testAge()
    {
        $person = new Person;
        $person->birthdate = '7/10/70';
        $this->assertEquals(43, $person->age);
    }

    public function testAgeWithMock()
    {
        \KDate::shouldReceive('make->yearsAgo')->andReturn('foo');

        $person = new Person;
        $this->assertEquals('foo', $person->age);
    }
}

class DateHandler
{
    ...

    protected $date;

    public function __construct($time=Null, $tz=null)
    {
        if ($time instanceof \DateTime) {
            $this->date = Carbon::instance($time, $tz);
        } else {
            $this->date = new Carbon($time, $tz);
        }
    }

    public function make($time=Null, $tz=null)
    {
        return new static($time, $tz);
    }

    public function yearsAgo($asOfDate=Null)
    {
        return $this->date->diffInYears(new Carbon($asOfDate));
    }
}

// app/config/app.php providers:
    'Kalani\Support\ServiceProviders\DateHandlerServiceProvider',

// app/config/app.php aliases:
    'KDate' => 'Kalani\Support\Facades\DateHandler',
```


Debug Bar
----------
Wow! It looks like there's a browser debug bar available for laravel and php. 

    "maximebf/debugbar": ">=1.0.0",
    "barryvdh/laravel-debugbar": "dev-master",


Still having problems with the date class. In this case, it's having problems with the timezone. Sometimes things get set in UTC, other times in the local timezone... Everything should be translated to local time.

Ahhhh... It looks like best practice is to store UTC, and translate it when it's provided to the user(s).


Codeception woes
------------------
Once again, codeception doesn't seem to be following a redirect. This is my test:

```php
    public function testLoginFailure(WebGuy $I)
    {
        $I->amOnPage('/login');
        $I->see('Log in');
        $I->fillField('Username', 'none');
        $I->fillField('Password', 'none');
        $I->click('Log in');
        $I->see('Incorrect username');
    }
```

I'm getting a failed test:

> Trying to test login failure (SecurityCest.testLoginFailure) - Failed

Maybe it's OK, though... This looks like it's in the result:

> confide::confide.alerts.wrong_credentials

That is showing up. So, how do we pick up the right verbiage?

Hmmmm... I'm not sure why it's not picking it up from the package, but it does work when it's in my project's lang folder.

==============================
I've been learning how to use a repository pattern, and am getting a little confused about where to put some things. 

I have a Person class and an EloquentPersonRepository class (described below). I would like to get a list of things most frequently purchased by a given person, and I'm not sure where to put it. 

The Person model has things like this:

    setBirthdateAttribute($birthdate)
    getBirthdateAttribute($value)
    getAgeAttribute()
    purchases()              // belongsToMany relation to Purchase model

PersonRepositoryInterface defines these methods: 

interface PersonRepositoryInterface
{
    public function findId($id);    // find a record by id
    public function create();       // create a new record  
    public function update($id);    // update a record      
    public function destroy($id);   // delete a record
    public function messages();     // return messages about the record's state    
    public function choices($list); // return items to populate select lists
                                    // (currently just gender)
    public function birthdays($from, $to)  // all people with birthdates in given range
}

EloquentPersonRepository implements that interface, and does all of the heavy lifting for record creation, updating, validation, and so on. I'm happy with that, and really happy that my controller is tiny.

Now, I'd like to add a couple of new methods:

    favoriteItems:  list a few of the the person's most-frequently purchased items
    suggestedItems: list items relevant to the 

Since these will be different for each person, would they go into the Person class?

Since they are implementing business logic, with data from several different models, would they go into the EloquentPersonRepository class? 

Or would they go somewhere else?

Any recommendations?

Hmmm... no one has gotten back to me on my query from yesterday. I guess that's something to let percolate for a bit.

==============================
I've really been cranking on the site, and it's been interesting. There are a few take-aways that I'm finding:

1. It's a lot easier to work with support objects, like interfaces and service providers, when they're all in the same place. I really don't like having them spread out throughout the system...One standard spot to find out what do my contracts look like?

2. I can incorporate multiple bindings in a single service provider. This wouldn't make sense if I were breaking things out for several different projects, but for a single project, it seems to be making a lot of sense at the moment.

3. I can make stubs for objects, and put them in place of the actual objects. eg,

```php
    $this->app->bind('Kalani\Support\Interfaces\PagesRepositoryInterface', function() {
        return new PagesRepositoryStub(
            new \Kalani\KWeb\Page\Page
        );
    });
```

4. On a new project, create similar objects in batches (eg, views, schema, seeds, models, repositories, etc)

4a. Put similar things together. Makes it lots easier to find them.

5. Seeding works better when using actual objects, so do things like this:

```php
    use Kalani\KWeb\Slug\Slug;

    class SlugsTableSeeder extends Seeder 
    {
        public function run()
        {
            DB::table('slugs')->delete();

            $slugs = array(
                array(21, 'about-us'),
                array(52, 'guest-information'),    
            );

            foreach($slugs as $slug) {
                $record = new Slug;
                $record->for_oid = $slug[0];
                $record->slug = $slug[1];
                $record->save();
            }
        }
    }
```

6. Be confused when things don't connect... :-)
