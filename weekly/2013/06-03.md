========================

I'm running into something weird, today. I changed something, and now for the simple views (called directly from the routing table), it's getting an error:

Class 'Url' not found

Other routes (from controllers) work fine.

When I changed Url to URL, it started working.

I want to play a little bit with something else. Let's say, the USDA Food Nutrient database....

There is some code to import it at:

Oh... interesting. There's an online reservation system in Laravel 4, called YARS (Yet Another Reservation System):
