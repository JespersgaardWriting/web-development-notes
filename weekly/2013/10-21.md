=================================

Working on a mini project today. Learning how to:

* Search multiple objects
* Separate a front-end from a back-end
* Validate and connect 1/M and M/M records



Tuesday, 22 October 2013
============================

I'm working with some front-end stuff today. 

I discovered that my FormBuilder class can work beautifully with error messages, if I include this in the css file:

```css
    .danger .form-control {
        border-color: #b94a48;
    }

    .danger .help-block {
        color: #b94a48;
    }
```

I would like more flexibility on the size of my FormBuilder items, though. 6 columns is a nice general size, but more would be nice, sometimes. And sometimes 6 is too many... Ideally I could select a template, somewhere, but where? And how to inject data into it?  (maybe as a view? Chumper/DataTables does something similar...)

I also now have a question on how to handle multi-selects. There's a beautiful script for the front end called [chosen](http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/). How to play nicely with it on the back-end?

The front-end sends two identical fields; the back-end converts it to one.

Ahhh... if I change the field name, it will work.

It was: tags
now:    tags[]

On the server, I now receive an array:

  'tags' => 
    array (size=2)
      0 => string '0' (length=1)
      1 => string '1' (length=1)

When I send data to the client, I'll also need to send an array.

I also need to extend my validator to check for tags.
And figure out how to incorporate multiple tags.
I would also, ideally, like to allow users to dynamically enter values in a select box, which can then be added to the tags list.

Hmmmm... It looks like chosen doesn't do that, but another package, [selectize.js](http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/), does.

```js
    $('.selectize').selectize({ 
        create: true, 
    });
```

It will send an index of items in the list, or a full text string for new items, like so:

  'tags' => 
    array (size=4)
      0 => string '0' (length=1)
      1 => string '3' (length=1)
      2 => string 'something' (length=9)
      3 => string '2' (length=1)

By default, it doesn't show a 'close' button, but that can be changed. We can include plugins:

```js
    $('.selectize').selectize({ 
        create: true, 
        plugins: ['remove_button'],
```

This works very nicely. I've also found that the button can be set to anything (including an icon from font-awesome). One strange thing with the latter, though, is that it doesn't work if you click directly on the icon (only in the space around the icon). I don't think it makes sense to use that, currently, but it's interesting to think about. To change the character:

```js
    $('.selectize').selectize({ 
        create: true,
        plugins: {
            'remove_button': { 'label': '<i class="icon-gear"></i>', }
        },
```

It looks like all of the plugs are compiled into the source for selectize.js. I did have to include a couple more projects to get it to work, though:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/sifter.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/microplugin.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/selectize.js/js/selectize.js"></script>

I'm really not sure how client-side package management is supposed to work... Theoretically, there are compilers (minifiers), and you'd have a source folder, and destination folders. It's all very abstract to me, so far.


### testing

I set up a couple of new snippets for testing:

    <snippet>
        <content><![CDATA[
    public function test${1:Name}()
    {
        \$this->assertEquals(${2:'expected'}, ${3:'test'});
    }
    ]]></content>
        <tabTrigger>t</tabTrigger>
        <scope>source.php</scope>
    </snippet>

And:

    <snippet>
        <content><![CDATA[
    public function testFalse()
    {
        \$this->assertTrue(False);
    }
    ]]></content>
        <tabTrigger>tf</tabTrigger>
        <scope>source.php</scope>
    </snippet>

These will make life a little quicker and easier.

    t  - create a test
    tf - create a failing test (make sure the test suite is readable)
    n  - insert docblock: @group now  (matches my n alias to run phpunit --group now)

Nice way to check for validation errors:

    $this->assertFalse($test->errors()->any(), 'Validation errors: ' 
        . $test->errors()->toJson());


### Laravel relationships

Now trying to figure out how to get a M/M relationship to work... From a tag, I can attach a related page like so:

    $tag->pages()->attach($pageId);

Can I check to see I'm not trying to attach something that's already there? Yes. Fairly simple:

    $foo = $tag->find($tagId)->pages()->where('id', $pageId);

It returns the specific page, or an empty collection if it's not found.

I can see if it's empty, by using ->isEmpty();

Next thing is to return a list of tags to the front-end, when I edit pages.

When I have several different objects on a page, how can I check validation for all of them? Should there be some sort of clearing house for input? Send some data items to one repository, and others to another? What would that look like?

Would I validate everything on the page first, or send it back? Would the controller do that? Something else?

Hmmm... suddenly I understand why I've been seeing form fields named things like this:

    name="user[login]"

It lets the server script divide things up appropriately.


### DataTables parameters

I remember going through this exercise before, but I don't think I included it in my notes. How can I submit extra parameters from a javascript datatables client to my server app? Much easier to find and use, this time (and revised notes to include):

    "fnServerParams": function ( aoData ) {
        aoData.push( { "name": "my_variable_name", "value": "my_value" } );
    }

I can modify the datatables template to include my parameters, but I'd really like it to be something I could set dynamically. 

Chumper/DataTables includes a setOptions method, which sets options for the table. It looks like it json-encodes them before writing it to the template. Maybe write a setCallbacks method that won't do extra encoding?

I've done that, but it looks like Table::setCallbacks is not being called. Why not??? In my view, I have this:

```php
    {{ DataTable::table()
        ->addColumn('slug', 'title', 'author', 'updated')
        ->setUrl(route('admin.pages.table'))
        ->setCallbacks(
            'fnServerParams', 'function ( aoData ) {
                aoData.push( { "name": "more_data", "value": "my_value" } ); 
            }')
        ->setFoo('bar')
        ->render('common.datatable') }}
```

setFoo is not getting called, either. I put a dd at the beginning of each, to check. Why aren't these methods getting called? If I put a dd at the beginning of setUrl, it acts correctly...

Right. Looking in the wrong place (/topics, instead of /topics/1). And now, the callback works correctly. Yay!

Now, how to get the linked records?

If I get an instance of the tags repository, we can get them:

    $tagsRepo = \App::make('KBase\Interfaces\TagsRepositoryInterface');
    return $tagsRepo->find(2)->pages()->get();

I find that extremely ugly, but it does work. Let's leave it for now, and see if I can get something better, later. Basically, what I have is this (for all linked tables):

```php
    public function datatable()
    {
        $fields = array('id', 'title', 'author_id', 'updated_at');

        if ($id = \Input::get('topic')) {
            $repo = \App::make('KBase\Interfaces\TagsRepositoryInterface');
            return $repo->find($id)->pages()->get();
        }
        if ($id = \Input::get('slug')) {
            $repo = \App::make('KBase\Interfaces\SlugsRepositoryInterface');
            return $repo->find($id)->page()->get();
        }
        if ($id = \Input::get('term')) {
            $repo = \App::make('KBase\Interfaces\TermsRepositoryInterface');
            return $repo->find($id)->pages()->get();
        }
        if ($id = \Input::get('author')) {
            $repo = \App::make('KBase\Interfaces\UsersRepositoryInterface');
            return $repo->find($id)->pages()->get();
        }

        return $this->model->get($fields);
    }
```

Not great, but functional...

On the client end, I think it would be nicer if I were to use ajax to edit some of the simple tables. tags, slugs, and terms are all just one word...

I downloaded xeditable for bootstrap3, and modified one of the controllers to look for ajax data:

```php
    public function update($id)
    {
        if (! \Request::ajax()) {
            return parent::update();
        }

        $values =  array(\Input::get('name') => \Input::get('value'));

        if ($updated = $this->repo->update($id, $values)) {
            return \Response::json(array('success' => 'changes saved'));
        }

        return \Response::json($this->repo->errors(), 400);
    }
```

All well and good. It's ugly, though. The font is way too big...

    #wrap .editable-error-block, .help-block, .has-error {
        font-size: 10pt;
    }

Next, how can I handle the json response? I'd like to convert it to a list of error messages, rather than a json string.

This works for some things...

```php
    error: function(response, newValue) {
        if(response.status === 400) {
            return 'Service unavailable. Please try later.';
        } else {
            return response.responseText;
        }
    }
```

This will work to get the first error in the list:

    error: function(response, newValue) {
        $obj = JSON.parse(response.responseText);
        return $obj['tag'][0];

This will work to get everything (one error per line):

    error: function(response, newValue) {
        $obj = JSON.parse(response.responseText);
        return $obj['tag'].join('\n');
    }

My final function looks like this:

```js
    $.fn.editable.defaults.mode = 'inline';

    $('.xeditable').editable({
        ajaxOptions: { 
            type: 'put',
        },
        error: function(response, newValue) {
            $obj = JSON.parse(response.responseText);
            return $obj['tag'].join('\n');
        }
    }); 
```

The editable object looks like this:

    <a href="#" class="label label-info xeditable" id="tag" data-type="text" data-pk="{{ $item->id }}" data-url="{{route('admin.topics.update', $item->id)}}" data-method="put" data-original-title="Name">

It looks like it's smart enough to pick everything up automatically from the data-* attributes. (except for the data method)

Here's a simple sample of the server-side work:

```php
    class SerieController extends BaseController
    {
        public function postQuickUpdate()
        {
            $inputs = Input::all();

            $serie = Serie::find($inputs['pk']);

            $serie->$inputs['name'] = $inputs['value'];

            return $serie->save();
        }
    }
```

There was a flaw with the 'final' function (above). It doesn't clear the field once a new record has been created. I entered this to create records with xeditable:

```js
    $('.xeditable-create').editable({
        value:  '',
        display: false,
        ajaxOptions: { 
            type: 'post',
        },
        success: function(response, newValue) {
            if (window.location.href != $(this).data('url')) {
                window.location.href = $(this).data('url');
            } else {
                $editableField = $(this);
                if(typeof getDataTable == 'function') {
                    getDataTable().fnDraw();
                }
            }
        },
        error: function(response, newValue) {
            $obj = JSON.parse(response.responseText);
            return $obj['tag'].join('\n');
        },     
    }); 

    $('.xeditable-create').on('hidden', function(e, reason) {
        $editableField.editable('setValue' , ''); 
    });
```

On the little knowlegebase app I've been working on the past few days, everything is working except for search. I've learned a lot, writing this:

* How relationships actually work, in practice
* Better grasp on how all of the pieces tie together
  (Controllers, Models, Repositories, Presenters, Views, Routers, etc.)

I also have some questions:

* Where to put things for related records??? This is a biggie. I have things in my PagePresenter class like 'presentTagList'. Is there a better place for them?  

* In my pages repository, I have a horrid datatable method, which basically goes through all of the associated relationships, instantiates a repo from the other side of the relationship, and finds my models, based on that. It works, but is ugly, and wouldn't scale nicely at all. Not sure what the fix is, though...

* Likewise, on create and update methods, I'm running methods from other objects. It would be much cleaner to not do that. These methods are also just about impossible to test. Yuck!




Saturday, 26 October 2013
============================
On to the issue of search. I just found out about a project called SphinxSearch. It looks really interesting. There's also a Laravel connector to it: https://github.com/scalia/sphinxsearch

    "scalia/sphinxsearch": "dev-master"

It looks like SphinxSearch runs its own server; we'll need to install and run that; the package installs a laravel wrapper for the client.

To get the server (binary) for Ubuntu, I can either download a binary:

    wget http://sphinxsearch.com/files/sphinxsearch_2.0.5-release-0ubuntu11~precise2_amd64.deb
    apt-get install libpq5
    dpkg -i sphinxsearch_2.0.5-release-0ubuntu11~precise2_amd64.deb

...or load a ppa (which is beta, but will be updated with `sudo apt-get upgrade`:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:builds/sphinxsearch-beta
    sudo apt-get update
    apt-cache search sphinx
    sudo apt-get install sphinxsearch
    dpkg -L sphinxsearch

Some instructions on using it:
http://www.andrehonsberg.com/article/install-sphinxsearch-205-in-ubuntu-1204-server

Configuration file:

    /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf 

On the client:

    php artisan config:publish scalia/sphinxsearch

In the process of setting this up, I had a thought that I'm not crazy about. Is this something that would even be deployable on a shared-hosting service? They don't generally allow software installations. It's going to be tricky to even get laravel on hostgator, because it's running php 5.2. Really!?!??!?

Hmmm... It would need a dedicated server, or virtual dedicated server... Vastly more expensive. I don't think I can justify it at this point, but it would be interesting to discuss later.

Looking for alternatives...

It turns out that search is a complex subject. :-)

For my purposes, I can use mysql fulltext searches.

I want to search several different fields, listed by priority:

    1. pages.title   10
    2. tags.tag      6
    3. users.name (author name) 6
    4. pages.body    1

I have a terms table, and could conceivably write to it every time a page is updated. That was my original idea. It could have a 'rank' column, also, to put in a multiplier for ranking (I'd get higher rankings based on the title, and less based on the body). It could also load things from title, tags, and user names...

Saving would be a little bit slow -- it would have to separate the body into words, then get the id for each word, then write the tables. I think it could work, though.

Could I do it with an observer?

Yes! Yay!

```php
    KBase\Models\Page::saving(function($request)
    {
        $repo = App::make('KBase\Interfaces\TermsRepositoryInterface');
        $repo->load($request);
    });
```

One issue: it takes a while to load. Any way that I could just spawn a process, and let it go in the background?

It looks like that's simple enough to do, with Laravel's Queue system, but again runs into the issue of having to run a daemon. Cannot, on a shared host. :-(
 
Actually, it looks like a VPS can be fairly inexpensive.

Speaking of events, something like this can be used after everything is done, but before sending final output to a user:

```php
    App::after(function($request, $response)
    {
        // HTML Minification
        if(App::Environment() != 'local')
        {
            if($response instanceof Illuminate\Http\Response)
            {
                $output = $response->getOriginalContent();
                
                $filters = array(
                    '/<!--([^\[|(<!)].*)/'      => '', // Remove HTML Comments (breaks with HTML5 Boilerplate)
                    '/(?<!\S)\/\/\s*[^\r\n]*/'  => '', // Remove comments in the form /* */
                    '/\s{2,}/'          => '', // Shorten multiple white spaces
                    '/(\r?\n)/'         => '', // Collapse new lines
                );
                
                $output = preg_replace(array_keys($filters), array_values($filters), $output);
                $response->setContent($output);
            }
        }
    });
```

============================
The knowledge-base app is now feature complete (including everything I originally wanted to set it up for). I think I made some bad decisions, near the end, particularly regarding searching, but it works.



My ugliest parts:

* How to attach a presenter to a collection, so items in the collection can be presented? I came up with this, but it's ugly...

```php
    public function recentlyUpdated()
    {
        $items = $this->model->recentlyUpdated()
            ->get(array('id', 'title', 'author_id', 'updated_at'));

        // TODO: Figure out how to use presenter attached to collection
        foreach ($items as $item) {
            $item = new PagePresenter($item);
        }
        return($items);
    }
```

* How to filter items based on the values of related objects? Again, this works, but it's ugly:

```php
    public function datatable()
    {
        $fields = array('id', 'title', 'author_id', 'updated_at');

        if ($id = \Input::get('topic')) {
            $repo = \App::make('KBase\Interfaces\TagsRepositoryInterface');
            return $repo->find($id)->pages()->get();
        }
        if ($id = \Input::get('slug')) {
            $repo = \App::make('KBase\Interfaces\SlugsRepositoryInterface');
            return $repo->find($id)->page()->get();
        }
        if ($id = \Input::get('term')) {
            $repo = \App::make('KBase\Interfaces\TermsRepositoryInterface');
            return $repo->find($id)->pages()->get();
        }
        if ($id = \Input::get('author')) {
            $repo = \App::make('KBase\Interfaces\UsersRepositoryInterface');
            return $repo->find($id)->pages()->get();
        }

        return $this->model->get($fields);
    }
```

* How to insert related objects?

* How to search and rank objects?

```php
    foreach($words as $word) {
        $found[] = \DB::table('pages')->where('title', 'like', "%$word%")
            ->get(array('id', \DB::raw('10 as mult')));
        $found[] = \DB::table('tags')
            ->join('page_tags', 'id', '=', 'tag_id')
            ->where('tag', $word)
            ->groupBy('page_id')
            ->get(array('page_id as id', \DB::raw('6 as mult')));
        $found[] = \DB::table('pages')
            ->join('users', 'author_id', '=', 'users.id')
            ->where('name', $word)
            ->groupBy('pages.id')
            ->get(array('pages.id as id', \DB::raw('40 as mult')));
        $found[] = \DB::table('terms')
            ->join('page_terms', 'id', '=', 'term_id')
            ->where('term', 'like', "%$word%")
            ->groupBy('page_id')
            ->get(array('page_id as id', \DB::raw('count(*) as mult')));
    }
```

Here's a forum post that talks about how to filter based on a M/M relationship:

> If you want to get all users which have tasks created_at $date you can do something like:

```
    $users = User::join('user_task', 'user_task.task_id', '=', 'task.id')->where('user_task_created_at', '=', $date)->get();
```

> If you want to filter all tasks of a user from $date:

```php
    $user = User::whereId(1)->with(array(tasks' => function($query)
    {
        $query->where('created_at', '=', $date);
    }))->first();
```

Another poster wrote:

```
    $slots = Slot::select('slots.*')->with('product')
        ->join('products', 'slots.product_id', '=', 'products.id')
        ->join('categories', 'products.category_id', '=', 'categories.id')
        ->where('categories.name', '=', 'MyCategory')->get();
```

```php

    {
        echo '<p>'.$sql.'</p>';
    });

    //Debugging Route

        $tasks = User::find(2)->tasks()->where('tasks.updated_at','LIKE',$date.'%')->get();

        //Beautification process :D
        echo "<div class='well'>";                                                                                                
        echo '<b> Results... </b>';
        //Echo your results here or
        foreach ($tasks as $task)
        {
            echo '<ul>';
            echo '<li>'.$task->name.'</li>';
            echo '</ul>';
        }
        echo "</div>";
        return View::make('debug');
    });
```

You can filter a collection like this:

```php
    $modules = $dropdowns->filter(function($model) {
        return $model->ref_type=='module';
    });
```

Attach M/M records like this:

```php
    Product::find($id)->categories()->attach( Input::get('category') );
```

Attach M/M records with pivot table data like this:

```php
    $customer->drinks()->attach($drink_id, array(‘customer_got_drink’, 1);
```

We can get an M/M/M (extended) relationship like this:

```php
class Customer extends \Eloquent {    
    public function drinks()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany('Drink', 'customer_drinks', 'customer_id', 'drink_id')
                    ->withPivot('customer_got_drink', 'chair_id')
                    ->join('chair', 'chair_id', 'chair.id')
                    ->select('drink_id', 'customer_id', 'pivot_customer_got_drink', 'chair.name AS pivot_chair_name'); //this select is optional
    }
}
```
