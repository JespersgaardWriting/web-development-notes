------------------------------
Let's see if I can queue an email message today...

Instructions at http://fideloper.com/ubuntu-beanstalkd-and-laravel4
also http://glenntaylor.co.uk/blog/read/laravel-queues-with-beanstalkd#.UxWf13VdUZo

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install -y beanstalkd supervisor
    $ sudo vim /etc/default/beanstalkd
    > START yes     # uncomment this line
    $ sudo service beanstalkd start
    $ sudo vim /etc/supervisor/conf.d/myqueue.conf
    Enter this, changing as needed:

    [program:myqueue]
    command=php artisan queue:listen --env=your_environment
    directory=/path/to/laravel
    stdout_logfile=/path/to/laravel/app/storage/logs/myqueue_supervisord.log
    redirect_stderr=true
    Start Supervisord:

    $ sudo supervisorctl
    > reread                # Get available jobs
    > add myqueue
    > start myqueue

All of that seems to be easy enough. My challenge is getting beanstalkd to work with Ubuntu 12.04...

Actually, that's not a problem. I can just run apt-get install beanstalkd...

I also installed the beanstalk console locally. Seems to work...

Ideally, I'd love to load the beanstalk console in a way that I can see it from my app... allow some users to see it from the front-end. I know that I can put a link in to public, making it available to anyone. I'll think more about this later.

I tried upgrading the version of Laravel for my Daily project to 4.1 today. At this point, my site is solidly broken....

> Class 'Illuminate\Routing\Controllers\Controller' not found

In the aliases section of app.php, I have this:

    'Controller'      => 'Illuminate\Routing\Controllers\Controller',

Ahhh... I only copied the providers array, not the aliases array, from https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/app/config/app.php
