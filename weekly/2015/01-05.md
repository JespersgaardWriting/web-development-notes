=======================
I'd be interested to find out if the Intervention image editor package can work with pdf files. Obviously, the (default) gd driver cannot. I can temporarily set it to the imagick driver, though...

What is the config option to set?

	Config::set('image::driver','imagick');

Hmmm.... It looks like I'm getting something. I just tried:

```php
    $dest = '/tmp/'.uniqid();
	Config::set('image::driver', 'imagick');
   	$thumb = Image::make($file);
   	$thumb->resize(300, null, function($c){
   		$c->aspectRatio();
   	});
   	$thumb->save($dest);
   	return $dest;
```

That seems to work fine...
