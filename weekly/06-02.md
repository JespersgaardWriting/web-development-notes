=======================

I'm having something weird happening with a test mock. The default isn't being overriden correctly. Basically, I'm doing this:


    public function setUp()
    {
        parent::setUp();

        $this->tab = $this->setupMockTab(self::TAB_CLASS);

    private function setupMockTab($class)
    {
        $tab = Mockery::mock($class);

        $tab->shouldReceive('inDateRange')->byDefault()->andReturn($tab)
            ->shouldReceive('forTotalsByAccountCode')->byDefault()->andReturn($tab)
            ->shouldReceive('get')->byDefault()->andReturn(array());

        return $tab;
    }

    public function testSummaryCanLoadDataFromTab()
    {
        $this->tab->shouldReceive('get')->once()->andReturn('x');

        $test = $this->test->getSummary($this->dates);

When $this->test->getSummary is called, $this->tab should be the value 'x', but it's the (default) empty value, instead. Not sure why... If I remove the andReturn(array()) statement, it returns a Null... Maybe get rid of the default alltogether, and duplicate code throughout?

Hmmm.... That only works if I don't have another function that returns a value. It looks like the first time it's set, it gets permanently attached. Weird...

Or, I could be looking at the wrong thing. Doh!
